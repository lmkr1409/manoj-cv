## Mutable Objects vs Immutable Objects
Everything in python is an object. All the objects can be either mutable or immutable.
-> Python handles mutable and immutable objects differently.

| Mutable Objects | Immutable Objects |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| An object which can change when there is some update operation happened. In Python mutable objects are | An object which can't be changed with any operation over the lifecycle of that object. In Python immutable objects are |
| Changing mutable objects is cheap | Expensive to change the objects, because doing so involves creating a copy |
|Slow to access compared to Immutable objects| Quicker to access than mutable objects|
|Mutable objects are great to use when you need to change the size of the object. |Immutable objects are used when you need to ensure that the objects created will always the same.|
| list, dict, set, bytearray | int, float, complex, str, bytes, tuple, frozenset|
|

### Key Note:
> The bindings of immutable objects are unchangeable, not the objects they are bound to.

Example:
```python
>>> t = ('x', [1,2])
>>> t[1] = [1,2,3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> t
('x', [1, 2])
>>> t[1].append(3)
>>> t
('x', [1, 2, 3])
>>> 
```
-> tuple t, is immutable but not the objects bound to the tuples. Since list is mutable we are able to change list object bound to the tuple t.

# Object References

Python doesn't have variables as such but instead has object references.

* when it comes to immutable objects like int, tuple there is such difference. As for mutable objects there is a difference.



### Q. How objects are passed to functions?

If the arguments created while function declaration are mutable then calling the function acts like call-by-reference.

If the arguments created while function declaration are immutable then calling the function acts like call-by-value

| Mutable Object as arguments | Immutable Object as arguments |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| When a mutable object is passed to a function, object can change inside the function as the object is mutable hence mutable parameters act like call-by-reference | When a mutable object is passed to a function, object can't change hence immutable parameters act like call-by-value |
| To avoid modifying the original object we need to copy the object to another variable | No need to copy the object as they can't change anyway|
|<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def updateList(list1):<br/>...     list1+=[10]<br/>... <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = [5,6]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n<br/>[5, 6]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; updateList(n)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n<br/>[5, 6, 10]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>|<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def updateNumber(num):<br/>...     num+=10<br/>... <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 5<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n<br/>5<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; updateNumber(n)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n<br/>5<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>|
| here passing call-by-reference | here passing is call-by-value|
|

### Q. Is Python call by value (or) call by reference:

A. Python uses a mechanism which is known as *call-by-object* sometimes also called *call by object reference* or *call by sharing*

* If we pass immutable objects arguments like integers, strings, tuples to a function then such passing will act like *call by value*

    * The objects passed to the function as parameters can't be changed because they can't be changed at all.
* If we pass mutable objects as arguments like list, set to a function then such passing acts like *call by reference*

## Copy Mechanism in python

In general when we assign a object to another temp object, python will just create a reference to the main object to temp object. 

-> If the object mutable then any change on temp object will reflect on the main object.

```python
>>> listObject = [1,2,3]
>>> tempObject = listObject
>>> listObject
[1, 2, 3]
>>> tempObject
[1, 2, 3]
>>> tempObject[0] = 9
>>> tempObject
[9, 2, 3]
>>> listObject
[9, 2, 3]
>>> 
```

One Exception here is, If we assign brand new list to tempObject and modify tempObject then there won't be any affect on listObject
```python
>>> l = [1,2,3]
>>> t = l
>>> l
[1, 2, 3]
>>> t
[1, 2, 3]
>>> t = [4,5,6]
>>> l
[1, 2, 3]
>>> t
[4, 5, 6]
>>> t[0] = 9
>>> l
[1, 2, 3]
>>> t
[9, 5, 6]
>>> 
```

### Q. What is the difference between shallow copy vs deep copy?

> copy or shallocopy will copy the objects of the reference object not the objects bound to the object

> deepcopy will copy the object bound to the referenced objects as well

|Shallow Copy|	Deep Copy|
| -- | -- |
|Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.|Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.|
|Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object|Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.|
|Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects.|	Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well.|
|Shallow copy is faster.	|Deep copy is comparatively slower.|
|

### 1. Object Reference
Object Reference will just create an reference to the original object, any modifications from the reference object will update the original object.
```python
>>> obj = [1,2,3,[4,5]]
>>> temp = obj # Object reference not copy/shallocopy
>>> temp
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> temp[0] = 9
>>> obj
[9, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> 
```

### 2. copy/shallocopy
While copy we copy objects of the original list then references created for each object from original object to temp object. When some object updated in temp object then 
* if the updated object is immutable then there won't be any affect on the original object
```python
>>> obj = [1,2,3,[4,5]]
>>> temp = obj[:] #Creates a copy
>>> temp[0] = 9
>>> temp
[9, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> obj #Note obj is not getting updated since objects are copied not just list reference
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> 
>>> from copy import copy
>>> temp = copy(obj)
>>> temp
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> temp[1] = 9
>>> temp
[1, 9, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> obj
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> 
```
* if the updated object is mutable then the original object will be updated
```python
>>> obj = [1,2,3,[4,5]]
>>> temp = obj[:]
>>> temp[3][0] = 9
>>> temp
[1, 2, 3, [9, 5]]
>>> obj
[1, 2, 3, [9, 5]]
>>> 
```

### 3. deepcopy
To avoid the updating mutable objects as well from the copied object we can use deepcopy
```python
>>> from copy import deepcopy
>>> obj = [1,2,3,[4,5]]
>>> temp = deepcopy(obj)
>>> temp[3][0]=9
>>> temp
[1, 2, 3, [9, 5]]
>>> obj
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
>>> 
```
